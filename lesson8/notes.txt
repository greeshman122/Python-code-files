Sets 
*Sets can hold unique values only. It cannot have duplicate values.
*It is represented by {}

Operations on sets : 

s1 = { 1,2,3,4,5}
s2 = { 4,5,6,7,8}

1.Intersection-It will give the common elements from both the sets.

i = s1.intersection(s2)
print(i)

2.Union-All the values from both sets will be printed except that common values will be written only once.

u = s1.union(s2)
print(u)

3.Difference-Common elements will be deleted and remaining elements from set 1 will be displayed.

d = s1.difference(s2)
print(d)

4.Symmetric Difference-Common elements will be deleted and the remaining elements from both the sets will be displayed.

sd = s1.symmetric_difference(s2)
print(sd)
